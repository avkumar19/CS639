# CS639- Final Project: NST using GANs

The given repository consists our code for the project.
1. The cGAN.py code consists of our conditional GAN implementation
2. wcGAN.py code consists of Wasserstein Conditional GAN implementation
3. The test.py code was ran to generate image samples after training the above two GANs. Make sure to add the name of pre-trained models shared in the repo as the model parameter.
4. Dataset code shows our logic to preprocess the dataset.
5. The files such as pre-trained models and datasets can be found on this google drive link - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xKiRaZMLNpkwqFMaKKRXFTSO63vmGhIV?usp=sharing

Note: The python code were actually ran using jupyter notebook. You can simply copy the python file in a new cell and run it to see the outputs.
